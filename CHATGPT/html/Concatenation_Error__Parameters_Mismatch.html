Failed to inject frame into filter network: Invalid argument<br />
Error while processing the decoded data for stream #113:0<br />
Conversion failed!<br />
ChatGPT<br />
The error message you received is from FFmpeg, a command-line tool used for manipulating multimedia files. The error indicates a problem with the concatenation (joining) of video streams due to a mismatch in input and output parameters.<br />
<br />
Specifically, the error message states that the input link "in4:v0" has parameters of size 512x666 and a sample aspect ratio (SAR) of 300:300. However, these parameters do not match the corresponding output link "in0:v0," which has parameters of size 512x666 and a SAR of 1:1.<br />
<br />
The error message "Failed to configure output pad on Parsed_concat_0" suggests that there was an issue with setting up the output configuration for the concatenation filter.<br />
<br />
The error "Failed to inject frame into filter network: Invalid argument" indicates that there was a problem passing the frames through the filter network due to an invalid argument.<br />
<br />
The final error "Error while processing the decoded data for stream #113:0" suggests an issue with processing the decoded data for a specific stream, specifically stream #113:0.<br />
<br />
To troubleshoot this issue, you can try the following:<br />
<br />
1. Check the command or script you are using for concatenation and ensure that the input and output parameters are correctly specified.<br />
2. Verify that the input files have the expected dimensions and SAR values.<br />
3. If you are using a script, ensure that there are no typos or mistakes in the script that could be causing the parameter mismatch.<br />
4. If you are using filters in your command, double-check the filter configuration and make sure they are set up correctly.<br />
5. Update your FFmpeg version to the latest stable release, as newer versions may have bug fixes and improvements that could resolve the issue.<br />
<br />
If the problem persists, please provide the FFmpeg command or script you are using, as well as more details about the input files and desired output, so that I can assist you further.<br />

Specifically, the error message states that the input link "in4:v0" has parameters of size 512x666 and a sample aspect ratio (SAR) of 300:300. However, these parameters do not match the corresponding output link "in0:v0," which has parameters of size 512x666 and a SAR of 1:1.   do I have to change the sar fow a 512x768 video ?<br />
ChatGPT<br />
Based on the error message, it seems that the sample aspect ratio (SAR) is causing the mismatch between the input and output links. The input link "in4:v0" has a SAR of 300:300, while the output link "in0:v0" has a SAR of 1:1.<br />
<br />
If you want to concatenate videos with different SARs, you have a couple of options:<br />
<br />
1. Adjust the SAR of the input videos: You can use FFmpeg's `setsar` filter to modify the SAR of the input videos to match the desired SAR of the output. For example, if you want the output video to have a SAR of 1:1 (square pixels), you can add the following filter to each input video:<br />
<br />
   ```bash<br />
   ffmpeg -i input1.mp4 -vf "setsar=1:1" -c:v copy modified_input1.mp4<br />
   ffmpeg -i input2.mp4 -vf "setsar=1:1" -c:v copy modified_input2.mp4<br />
   ```<br />
<br />
   This will create modified versions of the input videos with a SAR of 1:1.<br />
<br />
2. Resize the videos to have the same dimensions and SAR: If the aspect ratios of the input videos are significantly different, simply adjusting the SAR might result in distorted output. In such cases, it might be necessary to resize the videos to have the same dimensions and SAR before concatenating them. You can use the `scale` filter to resize the videos. For example:<br />
<br />
   ```bash<br />
   ffmpeg -i input1.mp4 -vf "scale=512:768" -c:v libx264 -crf 18 -preset veryfast resized_input1.mp4<br />
   ffmpeg -i input2.mp4 -vf "scale=512:768" -c:v libx264 -crf 18 -preset veryfast resized_input2.mp4<br />
   ```<br />
<br />
   This will resize the input videos to a resolution of 512x768 pixels while preserving the aspect ratio.<br />
<br />
After adjusting the SAR or resizing the videos, you can attempt to concatenate them again using the modified input videos. Remember to update the input file names in your FFmpeg command accordingly.<br />
<br />
Please note that resizing or adjusting the SAR of the videos may result in a change in the video's appearance. It's recommended to test the modifications on a small portion of the videos before performing the concatenation on the full videos.<br />

<br />
ChatGPT<br />
In the provided script, you are attempting to create a video from a shuffled list of image files. The `input_arg` variable is being built by looping through the shuffled files and adding each file as an input to FFmpeg using the `-loop 1 -t 00:00:00.2 -i ${file}` syntax.<br />
<br />
To address the aspect ratio (SAR) issue, you can modify the script to include the `setsar` filter in the FFmpeg command. Here's an updated version of the script with the necessary modifications:<br />
<br />
```bash<br />
TITLEimage="EXPERIMENT/result_image_with_text.jpg"<br />
VIDEOS="EXPERIMENT/XXXX1.mp4"<br />
<br />
# Use a glob pattern to match the image files in the directory<br />
file_list=(${DIR}*.jpg)<br />
<br />
# Shuffle the file list randomly<br />
shuffled_files=($(shuf -e "${file_list[@]}"))<br />
<br />
# Build the input argument for ffmpeg with the shuffled file list<br />
input_arg=""<br />
for file in "${shuffled_files[@]}"; do<br />
  input_arg+=" -loop 1 -t 00:00:00.2 -i ${file}"<br />
done<br />
echo ${input_arg}<br />
<br />
# Modify the FFmpeg command to include the setsar filter<br />
ffmpeg -hide_banner ${input_arg} -filter_complex "[0:v]setsar=1:1,scale=512:768[v];[v]concat=n=${#shuffled_files[@]}:v=1:a=0" -c:v libx264 -r 30 -pix_fmt yuv420p -t 58 -y ${VIDEOS}<br />
```<br />
<br />
In the updated script, the `setsar=1:1` filter is applied to the first input file (index `[0:v]`) to ensure a square pixel SAR. Additionally, the `scale=512:768` filter is applied after the `setsar` filter to resize the input images to the desired resolution of 512x768 pixels.<br />
<br />
Please note that the updated script assumes that you have the necessary FFmpeg installation and the input image files are present in the specified directory. Adjust the variables `DIR` and `VIDEOS` according to your specific setup before running the script.<br />

VIDEOS="EXPERIMENT/XXXX1.mp4" is an empty file maybe -t should be longer ?<br />
ChatGPT<br />
If the `VIDEOS` variable is an empty file, it is likely because the `EXPERIMENT/XXXX1.mp4` file does not exist or is empty. The `-t` option in the FFmpeg command specifies the duration of the output video, and currently, it is set to 58 seconds (`-t 58`).<br />
<br />
To address the issue, you can try the following:<br />
<br />
1. Verify that the `EXPERIMENT/XXXX1.mp4` file exists and is accessible at the specified location. Make sure the file is not empty and has the necessary permissions.<br />
<br />
2. If the file is empty or doesn't exist, you can either choose a different output file name or provide a longer duration for the output video. For example, you can change `-t 58` to `-t 120` to create a 2-minute video:<br />
<br />
```bash<br />
ffmpeg -hide_banner ${input_arg} -filter_complex "[0:v]setsar=1:1,scale=512:768[v];[v]concat=n=${#shuffled_files[@]}:v=1:a=0" -c:v libx264 -r 30 -pix_fmt yuv420p -t 120 -y ${VIDEOS}<br />
```<br />
<br />
3. Double-check that the `VIDEOS` variable is correctly set to the desired output file path and name. Ensure that the path is valid and you have write permissions for that location.<br />
<br />
Make sure to check the file existence, permissions, and provide an appropriate duration for the output video to address the issue.<br />
user<br />
I mean this t   input_arg+=" -loop 1 -t 00:00:00.2 -i ${file}"<br />
ChatGPT<br />
I apologize for the confusion. The `-t` option in the `input_arg` assignment specifies the duration for each image input in the loop. In your original script, it is set to `-t 00:00:00.2`, which means each image will have a duration of 0.2 seconds.<br />
<br />
If you find that the resulting video is too short, you can increase the duration per image to make it longer. For example, changing it to `-t 2` would make each image last for 2 seconds:<br />
<br />
```bash<br />
input_arg+=" -loop 1 -t 2 -i ${file}"<br />
```<br />
<br />
Adjust the value according to your desired duration for each image in the resulting video.<br />

ChatGPT<br />
The error message indicates that there is a parameter mismatch between the input and output links when using the `concat` filter. Specifically, it mentions a discrepancy in the size (resolution) and sample aspect ratio (SAR) of the input and output videos.<br />
<br />
To resolve this issue, you need to ensure that all the input videos have the same size (512x768) and SAR (1:1) as the desired output video. One or more of the input videos in your list may not match these specifications.<br />
<br />
Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:<br />
<br />
1. Verify the properties of the input videos: Check the resolution and SAR of each input video to ensure they match the desired output specifications. You can use FFmpeg's `ffprobe` command to get detailed information about the input videos. For example:<br />
   ```bash<br />
   ffprobe -i INPUT_VIDEO_FILE -show_streams<br />
   ```<br />
   Replace `INPUT_VIDEO_FILE` with the path to each input video file.<br />
<br />
2. Resize and set the SAR for the input videos: If any of the input videos have different dimensions or SAR, you can use the `scale` and `setsar` filters to adjust them. Modify the FFmpeg command accordingly:<br />
   ```bash<br />
   ffmpeg -hide_banner ${input_arg} -filter_complex "[0:v]scale=512:768,setsar=1:1[v];[v]concat=n=${#shuffled_files[@]}:v=1:a=0" -c:v libx264 -r 30 -pix_fmt yuv420p -t 58 -y ${VIDEOS}<br />
   ```<br />
   Ensure that the `scale` filter and `setsar` filter are applied to each input video appropriately.<br />
<br />
3. Check for any other filters or operations: If you have any other filters or operations in your FFmpeg command, make sure they are not causing conflicts or mismatches with the input and output parameters.<br />
<br />
By following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve any parameter mismatches causing the error.<br />

<br />
1. `scale=512:768` - Resize the images to a resolution of 512x768 pixels while preserving the aspect ratio.<br />
2. `setsar=1:1` - Set the Sample Aspect Ratio (SAR) to 1:1, ensuring square pixels.<br />
<br />
The resulting images will be concatenated and saved as an output video file named "output.mp4" using the libx264 codec. The video will have a frame rate of 30 frames per second and use the yuv420p pixel format.<br />
<br />
Please note that the command assumes that all the images in the "mkvid/" directory have a ".jpg" extension. If your images have a different extension, please modify the command accordingly. Additionally, ensure that FFmpeg is installed on your system and accessible from the command line.<br />

ChatGPT<br />
The command you provided appears to be correct. It sets the `DIR` variable to the directory path of your images and uses it in the FFmpeg command to process the images and create an output video.<br />
<br />
To execute the command, make sure you have FFmpeg installed on your system and accessible from the command line. Additionally, ensure that the directory path in the `DIR` variable points to the correct location of your image files.<br />
<br />
After running the command, FFmpeg will process the images, resize them to a resolution of 512x768 pixels, set the Sample Aspect Ratio (SAR) to 1:1, and save the resulting video as "output.mp4" in the current directory.<br />
<br />
Please note that the command assumes your image files have a ".jpg" extension. If your files have a different extension or naming scheme, make sure to adjust the command accordingly.<br />

how can I run this as a Python subprocess<br />
ChatGPT<br />
To run the FFmpeg command as a Python subprocess, you can use the `subprocess` module. Here's an example of how you can execute the command in Python:<br />
<br />
```python<br />
import subprocess<br />
<br />
DIR = "/home/jack/Desktop/HDD500/MyTube_AI_Flask_App/Project_TheOrigin/RAW_Story_resources/mkvideo/"<br />
<br />
# Construct the FFmpeg command<br />
command = [<br />
    "ffmpeg",<br />
    "-hide_banner",<br />
    "-i",<br />
    f"{DIR}%*.jpg",<br />
    "-vf",<br />
    "scale=512:768,setsar=1:1",<br />
    "-c:v",<br />
    "libx264",<br />
    "-r",<br />
    "30",<br />
    "-pix_fmt",<br />
    "yuv420p",<br />
    "output.mp4"<br />
]<br />
<br />
# Execute the FFmpeg command<br />
subprocess.run(command)<br />
```<br />
<br />
In this example, the `subprocess.run()` function is used to execute the FFmpeg command. The command is constructed as a list of strings, where each element represents a part of the command. The `DIR` variable is used to include the directory path of your images.<br />
<br />
Ensure that you have FFmpeg installed on your system and accessible from the command line. Also, make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the input images and write the output video in the current directory.<br />
<br />
After running the Python script, FFmpeg will be invoked as a subprocess to process the images and create the output video "output.mp4".<br />
user<br />
I want the DIR/outout.mp4  the same as DIR<br />
ChatGPT<br />
If you want the output video file to be saved in the same directory as the input images, you can modify the Python script to use the `os.path` module to extract the directory path from the `DIR` variable. Here's an updated version of the script:<br />
<br />
```python<br />
import subprocess<br />
import os<br />
<br />
DIR = "/home/jack/Desktop/HDD500/MyTube_AI_Flask_App/Project_TheOrigin/RAW_Story_resources/mkvideo/"<br />
<br />
# Extract the directory path from DIR<br />
output_dir = os.path.dirname(DIR)<br />
<br />
# Construct the output video file path<br />
output_file = os.path.join(output_dir, "output.mp4")<br />
<br />
# Construct the FFmpeg command<br />
command = [<br />
    "ffmpeg",<br />
    "-hide_banner",<br />
    "-i",<br />
    f"{DIR}%*.jpg",<br />
    "-vf",<br />
    "scale=512:768,setsar=1:1",<br />
    "-c:v",<br />
    "libx264",<br />
    "-r",<br />
    "30",<br />
    "-pix_fmt",<br />
    "yuv420p",<br />
    output_file<br />
]<br />
<br />
# Execute the FFmpeg command<br />
subprocess.run(command)<br />
```<br />
<br />
In this updated script, the `os.path.dirname()` function is used to extract the directory path from the `DIR` variable. The `os.path.join()` function is then used to construct the output video file path by combining the output directory and the file name "output.mp4".<br />
<br />
By running this script, the output video file will be saved in the same directory as the input images specified by the `DIR` variable.<br />
user<br />

# Execute commands as subprocesses<br />
subprocess.run(command1)<br />
subprocess.run(command2)<br />
subprocess.run(command3)<br />
```<br />
<br />
In this modified script, each command is represented as a separate list of arguments. The `subprocess.run()` function is used to execute each command as a subprocess. The output of each command is used as the input for the subsequent command.<br />
<br />
Ensure that you have FFmpeg installed on your system and accessible from the command line. Additionally, make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the input images, input video, and audio files, and write the output files.<br />
<br />
By running this Python script, the entire process will be executed as subprocesses, following the order of the commands specified. The resulting final video will be saved as `EXPERIMENT/{directory_name}{current_datetime}XX.mp4`.<br />

I want to run that in a Flask app .<br />
ChatGPT<br />
To integrate the above script into a Flask app, you can create a route in your Flask app that executes the script when the route is accessed. Here's an example:<br />
<br />
```python<br />
from flask import Flask, render_template<br />
import subprocess<br />
import os<br />
from datetime import datetime<br />
<br />
app = Flask(__name__)<br />
<br />
@app.route('/run_script')<br />

    # Create a filename with the current date and time<br />
    current_datetime = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S")<br />
    filename = f"EXPERIMENT/_file_{current_datetime}.mp4"<br />
    final_filename = f"{directory_name}{current_datetime}XX.mp4"<br />

    return render_template('result.html', final_filename=final_filename)<br />
<br />
<br />
if __name__ == '__main__':<br />
    app.run(debug=True)<br />
```<br />
<br />
In this example, a new route `/run_script` is defined, which triggers the execution of the script when accessed. After the script is executed, it renders a template called `result.html` and passes the `final_filename` variable to the template, which can be used to display the resulting filename to the user.<br />
<br />
Ensure that you have the necessary Flask and FFmpeg dependencies installed in your Flask app environment. Run the Flask app using `python app.py` or `flask run` command, and access the route `http://localhost:5000/run_script` in your browser to execute the script.<br />
<br />
You can create the `result.html` template file to display the result as per your requirement.<br />
user<br />
result.html ?<br />
ChatGPT<br />
Here's an example of what the `result.html` template file could look like:<br />
<br />
```html<br />
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br />
&lt;html&gt;<br />
&lt;head&gt;<br />
    &lt;title&gt;Script Execution Result&lt;/title&gt;<br />
&lt;/head&gt;<br />
&lt;body&gt;<br />
    &lt;h1&gt;Script Execution Result&lt;/h1&gt;<br />
    &lt;p&gt;The script has been executed successfully.&lt;/p&gt;<br />
    &lt;p&gt;Final video file: {{ final_filename }}&lt;/p&gt;<br />
&lt;/body&gt;<br />
&lt;/html&gt;<br />
```<br />
<br />
This template simply displays a heading and a paragraph indicating that the script has been executed successfully. It also displays the filename of the final video generated using the `{{ final_filename }}` variable, which is passed from the Flask route.<br />
<br />
Feel free to customize the HTML template based on your specific requirements and desired layout.<br />
