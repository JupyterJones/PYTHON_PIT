It appears that the reinstallation of the "python3-apt" package was successful, and the "apt_pkg" module has been restored. However, the error still persists when updating the APT package lists. Let's troubleshoot this further.<br />
<br />
The traceback indicates that the issue is arising from the script "APT::Update::Post-Invoke-Success" during the APT update process. This script is executed after a successful package database update.<br />
<br />
One potential solution is to disable the execution of this script temporarily. You can achieve this by editing the APT configuration. Open the file `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/10periodic` using a text editor with administrative privileges. Add the following line to disable the post-invoke script:<br />
<br />
```plaintext<br />
APT::Periodic::APT::Update::Post-Invoke-Success "true";<br />
```<br />
<br />
Save the file and then try updating the package lists again:<br />
<br />
```bash<br />
sudo apt update<br />
```<br />
<br />
If the error persists, we may need to investigate further. Check if there are any additional scripts or configurations causing conflicts. Additionally, ensure that the APT package manager and related components are up-to-date:<br />
<br />
```bash<br />
sudo apt-get install --reinstall apt<br />
sudo apt-get install --reinstall python3-apt<br />
```<br />
<br />
Following these steps should help resolve the issue. If the problem persists or if you have any additional information, please share it, and we can proceed with further troubleshooting.<br />

It seems like the issue with the APT package manager's post-update script persists. Let's try another approach by directly disabling the problematic script.<br />
<br />
Open the file `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades` with a text editor using administrative privileges. Add the following line to disable the problematic script:<br />
<br />
```plaintext<br />
APT::Periodic::APT::Update::Post-Invoke-Success {"/bin/true";};<br />
```<br />
<br />
Save the file and then attempt to update the package lists again:<br />
<br />
```bash<br />
sudo apt update<br />
```<br />
<br />
This modification should prevent the script from causing issues during the APT update process. If the error persists or if you encounter any other issues, please let me know, and we can explore alternative solutions.<br />

It seems that the issue persists even after attempting to disable the post-invoke script. Let's take a different approach by addressing the root cause of the problem.<br />
<br />
It appears that the "apt_pkg" module is still not recognized. You can try reinstalling the "python3-apt" package again to ensure that all necessary components are in place:<br />
<br />
```bash<br />
sudo apt-get install --reinstall python3-apt<br />
```<br />
<br />
After reinstalling, let's check if the issue persists. If it does, we may need to explore further options or potentially remove and reinstall the "python3-apt" package. Please let me know the outcome of the reinstall, and we can proceed accordingly.<br />

ChatGPT<br />
It looks like you are encountering a compilation error while trying to build Rufus from the source code. The error is related to an unrecognized command line option during the compilation of `libbled_a-bled.o`. The option causing the issue is `-Wbidi-chars=none`.<br />
<br />
To address this, you can try the following steps:<br />
<br />
1. **Check Compiler Version:**<br />
   Ensure that you are using a version of the GCC compiler that supports the `-Wbidi-chars` option. If you have an older version, consider upgrading your GCC compiler.<br />
<br />
2. **Modify Makefile:**<br />
   Edit the Makefile to remove or replace the problematic option. Follow these steps:<br />
<br />
   a. Open the Makefile using a text editor:<br />
<br />
      ```bash<br />
      nano /home/jack/Downloads/pbatard-rufus-b63f9ae/src/bled/Makefile<br />
      ```<br />
<br />
   b. Look for the line containing `-Wbidi-chars=none` and remove or replace it. It might look something like:<br />
<br />
      ```make<br />
      CFLAGS += -Wbidi-chars=none<br />
      ```<br />
<br />
      Change it to:<br />
<br />
      ```make<br />
      #CFLAGS += -Wbidi-chars=none<br />
      ```<br />
<br />
   c. Save the changes and exit the text editor.<br />
<br />
3. **Retry Compilation:**<br />
   After modifying the Makefile, try running the `make` command again:<br />
<br />
   ```bash<br />
   make<br />
   ```<br />
<br />
This should hopefully resolve the compilation error. If you encounter any other issues or if the problem persists, let me know, and we can further troubleshoot.<br />
<br />
