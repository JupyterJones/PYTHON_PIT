Run 'mkgallery' in subdirectories<br />

Certainly, Jack. To run the `mkgallery` command in all subdirectories, you can use a simple `find` and `exec` combination. Here's a one-liner bash command to achieve this:<br />
<br />
```bash<br />
find /path/to/your/directory -type d -exec sh -c 'cd {} && mkgallery' \;<br />
```<br />
<br />
Here's an explanation of what this command does:<br />
<br />
- `find /path/to/your/directory` searches for all subdirectories in the specified directory.<br />
- `-type d` filters only directories.<br />
- `-exec sh -c 'cd {} && mkgallery' \;` executes the `cd {} && mkgallery` command in each subdirectory found. `{}` is a placeholder for the directory name.<br />
<br />
Replace `/path/to/your/directory` with the actual path to your top-level directory. This command will run `mkgallery` in all subdirectories within that directory.<br />
<br />
Remember to navigate to the appropriate directory in your terminal before executing this command.<br />

can I use? :     find $pwd -type d -exec sh -c 'cd {} && mkgallery' \;<br />

You're on the right track, Jack, but there's a small issue with your command. When using `$pwd`, it should be enclosed in backticks (``) or `$()` to capture the output of the `pwd` command, which prints the current working directory. So the correct command should be:<br />
<br />
```bash<br />
find $(pwd) -type d -exec sh -c 'cd {} && mkgallery' \;<br />
```<br />
<br />
This will use the output of `pwd` as the current working directory and run `mkgallery` in all subdirectories from that location.<br />
<br />
Make sure you are in the correct directory or specify the path explicitly before running this command, as it will execute `mkgallery` in all subdirectories starting from the current working directory.<br />
