It looks like you're trying to create a function named `pick` that selects a random TrueType Font (TTF) file from a specified directory. However, the code snippet you provided is incomplete, and it seems like there might be a missing part.<br />
<br />
To help you more effectively, could you provide the specific requirements or functionality you want for this function? Additionally, if there are any issues or errors you've encountered, please let me know so I can address them in the corrected script.<br />

I only want files that ends with *.ttf<br />

Certainly! Here's the complete script for the `pick` function that selects a random TrueType Font (TTF) file from a specified directory, considering only files that end with *.ttf:<br />
<br />
```python<br />
import os<br />
import random<br />
import logging<br />
<br />
def pick(font_path):<br />
    try:<br />
        # Get a list of all files in the font_path directory that end with *.ttf<br />
        ttf_files = [x for x in os.listdir(font_path) if x.endswith('.ttf') and os.path.isfile(os.path.join(font_path, x))]<br />
<br />
        # Check if there are any TTF files in the directory<br />
        if not ttf_files:<br />
            logging.error(f"No TrueType Font (TTF) files found in the directory: {font_path}")<br />
            return None<br />
<br />
        # Choose a random TTF file from the list<br />
        selected_font = random.choice(ttf_files)<br />
<br />
        # Log the selected font<br />
        logging.info(f"Selected TrueType Font (TTF): {selected_font}")<br />
<br />
        # Return the full path to the selected font<br />
        return os.path.join(font_path, selected_font)<br />
<br />
    except Exception as e:<br />
        # Log any exceptions that occur<br />
        logging.exception(f"An error occurred in the pick function: {e}")<br />
        return None<br />
<br />
# Example usage:<br />
font_directory = "/path/to/your/fonts"<br />
selected_font_path = pick(font_directory)<br />
<br />
# Check if a font was successfully selected<br />
if selected_font_path:<br />
    print(f"Selected font path: {selected_font_path}")<br />
else:<br />
    print("Failed to select a font.")<br />
```<br />
<br />
This script includes logging to capture information about the font selection process and any potential errors. Feel free to adjust the `font_directory` variable to the path where your TTF files are located. Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!<br />
