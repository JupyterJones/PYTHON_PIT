To run the Firefox browser using the `subprocess` module in Python and open a specific HTML file, you can use the following code:<br />
<br />
```python<br />
import subprocess<br />
<br />
file_path = '/mnt/HDD500/FLASK/static/milestones_resources/comments/results.html'<br />
subprocess.run(['firefox', file_path])<br />
```<br />
<br />
This code utilizes the `subprocess.run()` function to execute the Firefox browser with the specified file path as an argument. The `file_path` variable should contain the absolute path to the HTML file you want to open.<br />
<br />
Make sure that Firefox is installed on your system and that it is included in the system's PATH environment variable so that the `firefox` command can be recognized and executed by `subprocess.run()`.<br />
