linux thunar stopped scrolling with mouse wheel ?<br />
ChatGPT<br />
It seems like you're facing an issue with Thunar on Linux, specifically related to scrolling with the mouse wheel. This could be due to various reasons, and troubleshooting may involve checking system settings, configurations, or potential bugs. Let's try a few steps to address this:<br />
<br />
1. **Check Mouse Settings:**<br />
   Ensure that your mouse settings are configured correctly. You can do this through your desktop environment settings or using a tool like `xinput`. Verify that the mouse wheel is recognized and properly configured.<br />
<br />
2. **Thunar Preferences:**<br />
   Open Thunar and go to Edit &gt; Preferences. In the "Behavior" tab, check if the "Enable mouse wheel zooming" option is selected. Sometimes, toggling this setting can resolve scrolling issues.<br />
<br />
3. **Update Thunar:**<br />
   Make sure you are using the latest version of Thunar. You can update Thunar using your package manager. For example, on a Debian-based system, you can use:<br />
<br />
   ```bash<br />
   sudo apt update<br />
   sudo apt install --only-upgrade thunar<br />
   ```<br />
<br />
4. **Check System Logs:**<br />
   Check system logs for any relevant error messages. You can use the `journalctl` command to view system logs:<br />
<br />
   ```bash<br />
   journalctl -xe<br />
   ```<br />
<br />
   Look for any error messages related to Thunar or mouse input.<br />
<br />
5. **Desktop Environment:**<br />
   If you're using a desktop environment like XFCE, the issue might be related to the overall desktop environment settings. Ensure that your desktop environment is up to date and try restarting it.<br />
<br />
6. **Mouse Driver:**<br />
   Ensure that your mouse driver is functioning correctly. If you are using a proprietary mouse driver, consider reinstalling or updating it.<br />
<br />
7. **Test with Another File Manager:**<br />
   To isolate the issue, try using another file manager to see if the scrolling issue persists. If it does not, the problem may be specific to Thunar.<br />
<br />
After trying these steps, if the issue persists, we can explore further solutions based on any specific error messages or details you find during the troubleshooting process. Let me know if you need assistance with any of these steps or if you find additional information from logs.<br />

In Jupyter Notebook, displaying images is typically done using the `matplotlib` library. If you have an image represented as a NumPy array (which is often the case when working with OpenCV), you can use the `imshow` function from `matplotlib.pyplot` to display the image. Here's an example:<br />
<br />
```python<br />
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt<br />
import cv2<br />
<br />
# Read your image using OpenCV<br />
img = cv2.imread('path/to/your/image.jpg')<br />
<br />
# OpenCV reads images in BGR format; convert it to RGB for display<br />
img_rgb = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)<br />
<br />
# Display the image using matplotlib<br />
plt.imshow(img_rgb)<br />
plt.axis('off')  # Turn off axis labels<br />
plt.show()<br />
```<br />
<br />
This code assumes that you have the image file at the specified path. If you have the image data directly in a variable (like `dst` in your example), you can skip the OpenCV reading step and use that variable directly.<br />
<br />
```python<br />
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt<br />
import cv2<br />
<br />
# Assuming you have 'dst' as your image data<br />
img_rgb = cv2.cvtColor(dst, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)<br />
<br />
# Display the image using matplotlib<br />
plt.imshow(img_rgb)<br />
plt.axis('off')  # Turn off axis labels<br />
plt.show()<br />
```<br />
<br />
Remember that in Jupyter Notebook, you don't need `cv.waitKey(0)` and `cv.destroyAllWindows()` because the image is displayed directly in the notebook cell.<br />
<br />
If you want to display multiple images or create subplots, you can modify the code accordingly. Let me know if you need further assistance or if you have a specific requirement for displaying images in your Jupyter Notebook.<br />

ChatGPT<br />
It seems like you are encountering an issue with the VideoWriter in OpenCV while trying to create a video from a sequence of images. The error message indicates a problem with the codec ID and format.<br />
<br />
To resolve this, you can try a different codec. Commonly used codecs include 'XVID' and 'MJPG'. Here's an updated version of your code using 'XVID':<br />
<br />
```python<br />
import os<br />
import cv2<br />
<br />
image_folder = 'path/to/your/images'<br />
video_file = 'output_video.mp4'<br />
fps = 30  # Adjust the frames per second as needed<br />
image_size = (width, height)  # Set the width and height of the images<br />
<br />
images = [img for img in os.listdir(image_folder) if img.endswith(".jpg")]<br />
images.sort()<br />
<br />
fourcc = cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'XVID')<br />
out = cv2.VideoWriter(video_file, fourcc, fps, image_size)<br />
<br />
for image in images:<br />
    img_path = os.path.join(image_folder, image)<br />
    frame = cv2.imread(img_path)<br />
    out.write(frame)<br />
<br />
out.release()<br />
```<br />
<br />
Make sure to adjust the path to your image folder, the output video file, the frames per second, and the image size according to your requirements.<br />
<br />
If you still encounter issues, you might need to install the 'XVID' codec. On Linux, you can usually install it using:<br />
<br />
```bash<br />
sudo apt-get install libxvidcore-dev<br />
```<br />
<br />
On Windows, you may need to download and install the Xvid codec from the official website.<br />
<br />
If you continue to face problems, you can try the 'MJPG' codec, which is another commonly used codec:<br />
<br />
```python<br />
fourcc = cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'MJPG')<br />
```<br />
<br />
Adjust the code accordingly based on your preferences and the specific requirements of your project.<br />

OpenCV: FFMPEG: tag 0x44495658/'XVID' is not supported with codec id 12 and format 'mp4 / MP4 (MPEG-4 Part 14)'<br />
OpenCV: FFMPEG: fallback to use tag 0x7634706d/'mp4v'<br />
ChatGPT<br />
It seems like there might be an issue with the 'XVID' codec on your system, and OpenCV is falling back to a different codec ('mp4v'). To resolve this, you can try using the 'mp4v' codec directly. Here's an updated version of your code:<br />
<br />
```python<br />
import os<br />
import cv2<br />
<br />
image_folder = 'path/to/your/images'<br />
video_file = 'output_video.mp4'<br />
fps = 30  # Adjust the frames per second as needed<br />
image_size = (width, height)  # Set the width and height of the images<br />
<br />
images = [img for img in os.listdir(image_folder) if img.endswith(".jpg")]<br />
images.sort()<br />
<br />
fourcc = cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'mp4v')  # Use 'mp4v' codec directly<br />
out = cv2.VideoWriter(video_file, fourcc, fps, image_size)<br />
<br />
for image in images:<br />
    img_path = os.path.join(image_folder, image)<br />
    frame = cv2.imread(img_path)<br />
    out.write(frame)<br />
<br />
out.release()<br />
```<br />
<br />
Make sure to adjust the path to your image folder, the output video file, the frames per second, and the image size according to your requirements.<br />
<br />
If you encounter issues with 'mp4v', you can also try the 'MJPG' codec, as it's another common codec for video compression:<br />
<br />
```python<br />
fourcc = cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'MJPG')<br />
```<br />
<br />
Choose the codec that works best for your needs and is supported on your system. If you continue to face problems, please provide more information about your system, such as the operating system and OpenCV version, so that I can assist you more accurately.<br />
