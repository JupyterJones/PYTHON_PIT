Zoom Overlay in Bash<br />

zoom_overlay $(pwd)<br />
i want to run zoom_overlay on the current diectory - a bash one liner<br />

Certainly, Jack! To create a one-liner bash command for running `zoom_overlay` on the current directory, you can use the following:<br />
<br />
```bash<br />
zoom_overlay "$(pwd)"<br />
```<br />
<br />
This command uses `$(pwd)` to get the current directory and passes it as an argument to `zoom_overlay`. The double quotes around `$(pwd)` ensure that the command works correctly even if the directory path contains spaces.<br />
<br />
Feel free to let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else you'd like assistance with!<br />
