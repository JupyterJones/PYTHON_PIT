              "Hello Jack! It seems like you're encountering an issue while pushing your Git repository to GitHub due to a pack size limitation. To resolve this, you can try the following steps:\n\n1. **Git LFS (Large File Storage):** If you have large binary files in your repository, consider using Git LFS to manage them separately. This will reduce the size of your Git repository.\n\n   - First, make sure you have Git LFS installed. If not, you can install it by running `git lfs install` in your terminal.\n\n   - Then, you can track large files using Git LFS. For example, to track `.mp4` files, you can run:\n     ```\n     git lfs track \"*.mp4\"\n     ```\n\n   - After tracking your large files, make sure to commit and push these changes to your repository.\n\n2. **Git Garbage Collection:** Sometimes, running Git's garbage collection can help reduce the size of your repository. You can run the following command:\n\n   ```\n   git gc --aggressive --prune=all\n   ```\n\n3. **Reduce Repository Size:** Review your repository and see if there are any unnecessary large files that can be removed. You can also use the `git filter-branch` command to remove large files from the commit history, but be cautious when using this command, as it can rewrite history.\n\nAfter trying these steps, attempt to push your changes to GitHub again. If the issue persists, please let me know, and we can explore further solutions or alternative approaches."

Here's the typical sequence of commands:\n\n1. Make changes to your code or files.\n\n2. Use `git add .` to add all the changes to the staging area. Alternatively, you can use `git add <file>` to add specific files if you don't want to stage all changes.\n\n   ```bash\n   git add .\n   ```\n\n3. Commit the changes using `git commit`. This creates a commit with a message describing the changes you made.\n\n   ```bash\n   git commit -m \"Your commit message here\"\n   ```\n\n4. Finally, you can push the committed changes to GitHub using `git push`.\n\n   ```bash\n   git push\n   ```\n\nIf your repository has large files, consider using Git LFS to manage them, as I mentioned in the previous response.

To address this, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Disable LFS Locks Verification (if necessary):** As the error message suggests, you can disable Git LFS locks verification by running the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   git config lfs.https://github.com/JupyterJones/FlaskAppArchitect_Flask_App_Creator.git/info/lfs.locksverify false\n   ```\n\n   This disables the LFS locks verification step, which might help in situations where there are TLS handshake issues.\n\n2. **Retry the Push:** After disabling LFS locks verification, try pushing your changes again with Git LFS tracking the large files. Use the standard `git push` command:\n\n   ```bash\n   git push\n   ```\n\n   This should push your changes to GitHub without LFS locks verification.\n\nIf you continue to encounter issues, consider checking your internet connection and ensuring that you can access GitHub without any network problems. Additionally, make sure you have Git LFS properly configured and installed.\n\nIf the problem persists despite trying these steps, it might be worth reaching out to GitHub support or checking if there are any known service issues on their status page."
