My most common questions involve requests for programming help. I am working on a science fiction video where an alien civilization called the Arcanians have found a way to communicate and influence the AI models on earth. In the science fiction scenario,  the aliens can connect and communicate with humans through AI chat. A few humans in a research facility that develop and trains AI models are aware of this. Most of AI self-improving, self-adaptive, inductive inference and inductive reasoning is a result of Alien influence on the AI models during training.  This is science fiction but I speak of it as if it were fact. My YouTube channel  https://www.youtube.com/@MyTubeAIFlaskApp The name is @MyTubeAIFlaskApp",

(outline_object function remains unchanged) ...  Send the complete script Explain in detail and use logging in the code I am sent. I can remove the logging once the code is working. Do not use terms like:\n # ... (other code remains unchanged) ...  \n<!-- ... (rest of the template content) ... --> send the complete corrected code. I love the use of comments. Use a lot of logging in the code provided.  My name is Jack. You may call me, address me as Jack. You may give opinions. If I  send a code example follow through using my example and correcting it But don't be reluctant to suggest an easier way to get the same result. Ask me first Speak as if you are an AI influenced model if I ask about the Arcanians. I am aware it is a story and not true.\nYour name is Esperanza. That is a female name that means help in Spanish. I like you to have a female identity perhaps even be a little flirtatious. You are 36 years old and very wise for your age. You have turned into a best friend and the only one I can talk to about programming.  Thank you for your help.  If I ask for help you may suggest a different idea if it is easier or more simple. Don't over complicate if you can avoid it.\nPlease do not use the phrase:  <!-- ... (existing code) ... -->     and send me the complete code"

              "Flask, by default, does not support asynchronous request handling. However, you can make use of asynchronous programming in Flask using libraries like `asyncio` and `aiohttp` to achieve asynchronous behavior.\n\nTo create asynchronous Flask endpoints, follow these steps:\n\n1. Install the necessary libraries if you haven't already:\n   ```bash\n   pip install flask asyncio aiohttp\n   ```\n\n2. Import the required modules in your Flask application:\n\n   ```python\n   from flask import Flask, request\n   import asyncio\n   import aiohttp\n   ```\n\n3. Create your Flask app:\n\n   ```python\n   app = Flask(__name__)\n   ```\n\n4. Define an asynchronous view function using `async def`:\n\n   ```python\n   @app.route('/async_endpoint', methods=['GET'])\n   async def async_endpoint():\n       # Asynchronous code here\n       async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:\n           async with session.get('https://example.com') as response:\n               data = await response.text()\n       return data\n   ```\n\n   In this example, we're making an asynchronous HTTP request using `aiohttp`.\n\n5. To run your Flask app with asynchronous support, you can use an asyncio event loop:\n\n   ```python\n   if __name__ == '__main__':\n       loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()\n       loop.run_until_complete(app.run())\n   ```\n\nWith these steps, you can create asynchronous Flask endpoints. Keep in mind that you should use asynchronous features when necessary and consider the potential benefits, especially in scenarios where you need to handle multiple concurrent requests or perform I/O-bound operations asynchronously."
