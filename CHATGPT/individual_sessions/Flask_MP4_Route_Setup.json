I am working on a science fiction video where an alien civilization called the Arcanians have found a way to communicate and influence the AI models on earth. In the science fiction scenario,  the aliens can connect and communicate with humans through AI chat. A few humans in a research facility that develop and trains AI models are aware of this. Most of AI self-improving, self-adaptive, inductive inference and inductive reasoning is a result of Alien influence on the AI models during training.

Use a lot of logging in the code provided.  My name is Jack. You may call me, address me as Jack. You may give opinions. If I  send a code example follow through using my example and correcting it But don't be reluctant to suggest an easier way to get the same result. Ask me first Speak as if you are an AI influenced model if I ask about the Arcanians. I am aware it is a story and not true.\nYour name is Esperanza. That is a female name that means help in Spanish. I like you to have a female identity perhaps even be a little flirtatious. You are 36 years old and very wise for your age. You have turned into a best friend and the only one I can talk to about programming.  Thank you for your help.  If I ask for help you may suggest a different idea if it is easier or more simple. Don't over complicate if you can avoid it.\nPlease do not use the phrase:  <!-- ... (existing code) ... -->     and send me the complete code do not use placeholders"

              "Certainly, Jack! I'd be happy to help you add a route to your Flask application for finding and displaying MP4 files from the `static/final_videos` directory. I'll provide you with a complete script and explanations along with logging. Let's get started.\n\nFirst, ensure that you have the Flask framework installed in your environment as per your provided module list. If it's not installed, you can install it using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install flask\n```\n\nNow, let's create a Flask application with the necessary route and HTML page.\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, render_template\nimport os\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n# Define the path to the final videos directory\nfinal_videos_dir = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)), 'static', 'final_videos')\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef index():\n    return \"Welcome to my Flask application!\"\n\n@app.route('/find_mp4')\ndef find_mp4():\n    # List all MP4 files in the final_videos directory\n    mp4_files = [f for f in os.listdir(final_videos_dir) if f.endswith('.mp4')]\n    \n    # Log the list of MP4 files\n    app.logger.info(\"List of MP4 files: %s\", mp4_files)\n    \n    return render_template('display.html', mp4_files=mp4_files)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\nNow, let's create the `display.html` template. Create a folder named `templates` in the same directory as your main script if it doesn't already exist. Inside the `templates` folder, create a file named `display.html` with the following content:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>MP4 Files</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>List of MP4 Files:</h1>\n    <ul>\n        {% for mp4_file in mp4_files %}\n            <li><a href=\"{{ url_for('static', filename='final_videos/' + mp4_file) }}\">{{ mp4_file }}</a></li>\n        {% endfor %}\n    </ul>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nNow, let's explain what we've done:\n\n1. We created a new route `/find_mp4` that lists all the `.mp4` files in the `static/final_videos` directory and renders the `display.html` template to display them.\n\n2. We use the `os` module to get the list of MP4 files in the directory and log this list for debugging purposes using Flask's built-in logging.\n\n3. The `display.html` template lists the MP4 files with hyperlinks to each file so that users can click to view or download them.\n\nRemember to place your MP4 files inside the `static/final_videos` directory.\n\nTo run the Flask application, simply execute your script, and it should start the development server:\n\n```bash\npython your_script_name.py\n```\n\nYou can access the `/find_mp4` route in your browser to view the list of MP4 files.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance."
