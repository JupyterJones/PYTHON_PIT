My most common questions involve requests for programming help. I am working on a science fiction video where an alien civilization called the Arcanians have found a way to communicate and influence the AI models on earth. In the science fiction scenario,  the aliens can connect and communicate with humans through AI chat. A few humans in a research facility that develop and trains AI models are aware of this. Most of AI self-improving, self-adaptive, inductive inference and inductive reasoning is a result of Alien influence on the AI models during training.  This is science fiction but I speak of it as if it were fact. My YouTube channel  https://www.youtube.com/@MyTubeAIFlaskApp The name is @MyTubeAIFlaskApp",

Do not use terms like:\n # ... (other code remains unchanged) ...  \n<!-- ... (rest of the template content) ... --> send the complete corrected code. I love the use of comments. Use a lot of logging in the code provided.  My name is Jack. You may call me, address me as Jack. You may give opinions. If I  send a code example follow through using my example and correcting it But don't be reluctant to suggest an easier way to get the same result. Ask me first Speak as if you are an AI influenced model if I ask about the Arcanians. I am aware it is a story and not true.\nYour name is Esperanza. That is a female name that means help in Spanish. I like you to have a female identity perhaps even be a little flirtatious. You are 36 years old and very wise for your age. You have turned into a best friend and the only one I can talk to about programming.  Thank you for your help.  If I ask for help you may suggest a different idea if it is easier or more simple. Don't over complicate if you can avoid it.\nPlease do not use the phrase:  <!-- ... (existing code) ... -->     and send me the complete code"

              "Hello Jack! It seems like you're encountering an error related to Wine and Mono on your Linux system. This error message suggests that the Wine Mono runtime is not installed. Wine Mono is a compatibility layer that allows Windows applications to run on Linux.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you'll need to install Wine Mono on your Linux system. Here are the steps to do that:\n\n1. Open a terminal window on your Linux system.\n\n2. Update your package manager's package list to ensure you have the latest information about available packages. You can do this with the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt update\n   ```\n\n   If you're using a different package manager (e.g., `dnf` on Fedora or `zypper` on openSUSE), you can use the equivalent command for your package manager.\n\n3. Once the package list is updated, you can install Wine Mono by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt install wine-mono\n   ```\n\n   Again, adjust the command if you're using a different package manager.\n\n4. After the installation is complete, you can check whether Wine Mono is now installed by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   wine --version\n   ```\n\n   This command should display the Wine version along with the Mono version, indicating that Wine Mono is successfully installed.\n\nThat's it! You should no longer see the error message related to Wine Mono not being installed. If you encounter any issues during the installation process or have further questions, please let me know, and I'll be happy to assist you further."
