              "To open a Jupyter Notebook over a local area network (LAN), you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Install Jupyter Notebook**: If you haven't already, you need to install Jupyter Notebook. You can do this using pip:\n\n   ```\n   pip install jupyter\n   ```\n\n2. **Start a Jupyter Notebook Server**: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you want to work, and run the following command:\n\n   ```\n   jupyter notebook\n   ```\n\n   This will start the Jupyter Notebook server locally, and it will provide you with a URL like `http://localhost:8888/` in your terminal.\n\n3. **Access Jupyter Notebook Over LAN**:\n   To access your Jupyter Notebook over the LAN, you need to find your computer's local IP address. You can usually find this by running the following command:\n\n   - On Linux or macOS:\n\n     ```\n     ifconfig\n     ```\n\n   - On Windows:\n\n     ```\n     ipconfig\n     ```\n\n   Look for the IPv4 address of your active network connection (usually labeled as \"inet\" or \"IPv4 Address\").\n\n4. Using a device on your LAN (e.g., another computer or a smartphone), open a web browser and enter the following address:\n\n   ```\n   http://your_local_ip:8888\n   ```\n\n   Replace `your_local_ip` with the actual IP address you found in step 3. Also, ensure that the port (default is 8888) matches the one displayed when you started the Jupyter Notebook server.\n\n5. You should now have access to your Jupyter Notebook over the LAN, and you can create, open, and edit notebooks as usual.\n\nPlease note that you might need to adjust your firewall or network settings to allow access over the LAN. Also, make sure your devices are connected to the same network for this to work.\n\nIf you encounter any issues or need further assistance, please let me know, and I can provide more specific guidance."

              "If you have verified that your computer's local IP address is `192.168.0.108` and the Jupyter Notebook server is running at `http://localhost:8888/tree` on your computer, you should be able to access it over the LAN using the same IP address and port.\n\nHowever, sometimes Jupyter Notebook binds to `localhost` by default, which restricts access to only your local computer. To enable access over the LAN, you can modify the Jupyter Notebook configuration. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Open a terminal on your computer.\n\n2. Generate a Jupyter Notebook configuration file if you haven't already by running:\n\n   ```\n   jupyter notebook --generate-config\n   ```\n\n3. Open the Jupyter Notebook configuration file in a text editor. You can find the path to the file in the terminal output, or you can navigate to `~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py` (Linux/macOS) or `C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\.jupyter\\jupyter_notebook_config.py` (Windows).\n\n4. Search for the line that starts with `c.NotebookApp.ip`. By default, it might be set to `'localhost'`. You should change it to:\n\n   ```\n   c.NotebookApp.ip = '0.0.0.0'\n   ```\n\n   This will make Jupyter Notebook listen on all available network interfaces, including your LAN.\n\n5. Save the configuration file and close the text editor.\n\n6. Restart the Jupyter Notebook server:\n\n   ```\n   jupyter notebook\n   ```\n\nNow, you should be able to access your Jupyter Notebook from devices on your LAN using:\n\n```\nhttp://192.168.0.108:8888/\n```\n\nMake sure you're using the correct port (8888 in this case). If you're still having issues, ensure that your firewall or any security software isn't blocking the connection. Also, ensure that your LAN devices are indeed on the same network.\n\nIf you still face problems or need further assistance, please let me know, and I'll do my best to help."
