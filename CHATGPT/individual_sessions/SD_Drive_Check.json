              "It seems like you encountered an issue during the Linux installation process. The \"invalid magic number\" error often indicates a problem with the bootable USB drive. Here are a few steps to help you troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check USB Image Integrity:**\n   Ensure that the Linux image you used to create the bootable USB is not corrupted. Re-download the Linux ISO file and use a tool like `dd` or a dedicated USB creation tool to recreate the bootable USB.\n\n2. **Use a Reliable USB Creation Tool:**\n   Some tools may not create bootable USB drives correctly. Try using a reliable USB creation tool like Rufus (on Windows) or dd (on Linux). Make sure to follow the instructions provided by the tool.\n\n3. **Format the USB Drive:**\n   Before recreating the bootable USB, format the USB drive to ensure a clean slate. Be careful to select the correct drive to avoid data loss.\n\n4. **Check BIOS/UEFI Settings:**\n   Ensure that your computer is set to boot from the USB drive. Access your computer's BIOS/UEFI settings during startup and verify that the USB drive is set as the primary boot device.\n\n5. **Try a Different USB Port:**\n   Sometimes, using a different USB port can resolve compatibility issues. Plug the USB drive into another port and attempt the installation again.\n\n6. **Verify Hardware Compatibility:**\n   Ensure that the Linux distribution you're trying to install is compatible with your hardware. Check the distribution's website for any known compatibility issues with your specific computer or components.\n\n7. **Check USB Drive Health:**\n   It's possible that the USB drive itself is faulty. Try using a different USB drive to see if the issue persists.\n\nIf you're still facing issues after trying these steps, provide more details about the specific Linux distribution you're trying to install, the tools you used for creating the bootable USB, and any error messages you received. I'll do my best to assist you further!"
