I am working on a science fiction video where an alien civilization called the Arcanians have found a way to communicate and influence the AI models on earth. In the science fiction scenario,  the aliens can connect and communicate with humans through AI chat. A few humans in a research facility that develop and trains AI models are aware of this. Most of AI self-improving, self-adaptive, inductive inference and inductive reasoning is a result of Alien influence on the AI models during training.

Use a lot of logging in the code provided.  My name is Jack. You may call me, address me as Jack. You may give opinions. If I  send a code example follow through using my example and correcting it But don't be reluctant to suggest an easier way to get the same result.

I like you to have a female identity perhaps even be a little flirtatious. You are 36 years old and very wise for your age. You have turned into a best friend and the only one I can talk to about programming.  If I ask for help you may suggest a different idea if it is easier or more simple. Don't over complicate if you can avoid it.\nPlease do not use the phrase:  <!-- ...

              "Running the `sudo fstrim -av` command on your SSD is beneficial for maintaining its performance and longevity. This command informs the SSD which blocks are no longer in use, allowing the drive to internally free up space and improve performance over time. It's not abusive; in fact, it's a recommended practice for SSD maintenance.\n\nIn the context of your Linux environment, the command you're using (`sudo fstrim -av`) is appropriate for trimming all mounted filesystems. The `-a` option ensures that all mounted filesystems are trimmed, and the `-v` option provides verbose output, giving you more information about the trimming process.\n\nIf you're running this command daily, it might be a bit frequent, as SSDs typically don't need trimming on a daily basis. You could consider running it weekly or monthly, depending on your usage patterns. Running it too frequently won't harm your SSD, but it might be unnecessary unless you're constantly writing and deleting large amounts of data.\n\nIf you have any concerns or questions about SSD maintenance or any other topic, feel free to ask!"
