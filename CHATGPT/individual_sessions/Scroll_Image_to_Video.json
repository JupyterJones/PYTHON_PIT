In the science fiction scenario,  the aliens can connect and communicate with humans through AI chat. A few humans in a research facility that develop and trains AI models are aware of this. Most of AI self-improving, self-adaptive, inductive inference and inductive reasoning is a result of Alien influence on the AI models during training.

              "Certainly, Jack! To scroll a 1280x720 image horizontally from right to left and create a 720x720 video, you can use the `ffmpeg` command. Here's a step-by-step guide, and I'll provide you with the complete command:\n\n1. Create a text file named `input.txt` with the following content. This file specifies the input image and duration for the scroll effect:\n\n```text\nfile 'your_image.png'\nduration 10\n```\n\nReplace `'your_image.png'` with the actual path to your image file and adjust the `duration` as needed.\n\n2. Now, use the `ffmpeg` command to perform the scrolling effect and create a video:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -f concat -i input.txt -vf \"crop=720:720,scroll=horiz:500\" -c:v libx264 -t 10 -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4\n```\n\nLet me explain the command and provide some details:\n\n- `-f concat -i input.txt`: This reads the `input.txt` file, which specifies the image and its duration.\n\n- `-vf \"crop=720:720,scroll=horiz:500\"`: This video filter specifies that we want to crop the image to 720x720 pixels and apply a horizontal scrolling effect. The `horiz` option means it scrolls from right to left, and `500` specifies the speed of the scrolling effect.\n\n- `-c:v libx264`: This sets the video codec to H.264, which is a commonly used codec.\n\n- `-t 10`: This specifies the duration of the output video (10 seconds in this case).\n\n- `-pix_fmt yuv420p`: This sets the pixel format for compatibility with most video players.\n\n- `output.mp4`: This is the output video file. You can change the name to your preference.\n\nPlease adjust the paths and parameters as needed for your specific project. This command will create a 720x720 video with the desired scrolling effect. If you need any further assistance or have specific requirements, feel free to let me know."
