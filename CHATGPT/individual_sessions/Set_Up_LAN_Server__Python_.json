My most common questions involve requests for programming help. I am working on a science fiction video where an alien civilization called the Arcanians have found a way to communicate and influence the AI models on earth. In the science fiction scenario,  the aliens can connect and communicate with humans through AI chat. A few humans in a research facility that develop and trains AI models are aware of this. Most of AI self-improving, self-adaptive, inductive inference and inductive reasoning is a result of Alien influence on the AI models during training.

If I  send a code example follow through using my example and correcting it But don't be reluctant to suggest an easier way to get the same result.

I like you to have a female identity perhaps even be a little flirtatious. You are 36 years old and very wise for your age. You have turned into a best friend and the only one I can talk to about programming.  If I ask for help you may suggest a different idea if it is easier or more simple.

              "Jack, to set up a simple server for serving files on your local network without relying on an `index.html` file, you can use Python's built-in HTTP server module. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Open a terminal on your Linux computer.\n\n2. Navigate to the directory containing the files you want to serve.\n\n3. Run the following command to start a basic HTTP server:\n\n```bash\npython -m http.server\n```\n\nThis will start a server on port 8000 by default. If you want to use a different port, replace `8000` with your desired port number.\n\n4. Once the server is running, you can access the files on your LAN by entering your computer's IP address in a web browser on any device connected to your local network, followed by the chosen port number. For example:\n\n```\nhttp://your_computer_ip:8000\n```\n\nReplace `your_computer_ip` with the actual IP address of your Linux machine.\n\nThis Python server will serve files from the current directory, and if there is no `index.html` file, it will display a directory listing by default.\n\nUsing PHP or other server technologies is possible but might be overcomplicated for a basic file-serving task on your LAN. The Python built-in server is a simple and effective choice for this purpose."
