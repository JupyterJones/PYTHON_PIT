              "It seems like you're encountering an issue related to Protocol Buffers (protobuf) in your Python project. The error message suggests that your generated code is out of date and needs to be regenerated with a version of `protoc` that is 3.19.0 or higher.\n\nTo address this issue, you have a few options:\n\n1. **Regenerate Protobuf Code**: The recommended approach is to regenerate your protobuf code using a version of `protoc` that is 3.19.0 or newer. You can do this by installing the latest version of Protocol Buffers and then running the `protoc` command to generate the Python code from your `.proto` files. Make sure your Python environment is set up to use this updated code.\n\n2. **Downgrade Protobuf Package**: If regenerating the code immediately is not feasible, you can try downgrading the `protobuf` package in your Python environment to version 3.20.x or lower. This may allow your current code to work with the existing generated protobuf code.\n\n3. **Use Pure-Python Parsing**: As a temporary workaround, you can set the `PROTOCOL_BUFFERS_PYTHON_IMPLEMENTATION` environment variable to \"python.\" This will use pure-Python parsing for protobuf, but it may be much slower than the optimized C++ parsing. This is not recommended for production use but can be helpful for debugging or development purposes.\n\nTo set the environment variable, you can do it in your Python script before importing any protobuf-related modules:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ[\"PROTOCOL_BUFFERS_PYTHON_IMPLEMENTATION\"] = \"python\"\n```\n\nRemember that these are temporary solutions, and it's best to update your protobuf code generation to match the required version for long-term stability.\n\nIf you need assistance with specific code related to this issue or have further questions, please provide more details, and I'll be happy to help."

              "To downgrade the `protobuf` package to version 3.20.x or lower in your Python environment, you can use the `pip` package manager. Here are the steps to do this:\n\n1. **Check the Current Version**: Before downgrading, it's a good practice to check the current version of the `protobuf` package in your environment. You can do this using the following command:\n\n   ```\n   pip show protobuf\n   ```\n\n   This command will display information about the installed `protobuf` package, including its version.\n\n2. **Uninstall the Current Version**: To downgrade, you first need to uninstall the current version of the `protobuf` package. Use the following command to uninstall it:\n\n   ```\n   pip uninstall protobuf\n   ```\n\n   Follow the prompts to confirm the uninstallation.\n\n3. **Install the Desired Version**: Now that you've uninstalled the current version, you can install the specific version you want. For example, if you want to install version 3.20.0, you can use this command:\n\n   ```\n   pip install protobuf==3.20.0\n   ```\n\n   Replace \"3.20.0\" with the specific version you want to install.\n\n4. **Verify the Installation**: After installation, you can verify that the correct version is installed by running the following command:\n\n   ```\n   pip show protobuf\n   ```\n\n   This should display information about the newly installed version, confirming that you have downgraded to the desired version.\n\nKeep in mind that downgrading a package might affect other packages in your project that depend on the newer version. Be cautious and ensure that downgrading doesn't introduce any compatibility issues with your project.\n\nIf you encounter any problems or have specific requirements related to your project, please provide more details, and I'll be happy to assist further."
