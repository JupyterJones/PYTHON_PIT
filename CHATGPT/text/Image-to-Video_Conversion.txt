Sure! To create a video using a directory of images with MoviePy, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the required libraries:
   ```
   pip install moviepy
   ```

2. Import the necessary modules:
   ```python
   from moviepy.editor import ImageSequenceClip
   import os
   ```

3. Set the directory path where your images are located:
   ```python
   image_directory = "/path/to/directory"
   ```

4. Get a list of image file names in the directory:
   ```python
   image_files = sorted([f for f in os.listdir(image_directory) if f.endswith(".jpg") or f.endswith(".png")])
   ```

5. Create a list of image paths:
   ```python
   image_paths = [os.path.join(image_directory, filename) for filename in image_files]
   ```

6. Create a clip from the image sequence:
   ```python
   clip = ImageSequenceClip(image_paths, durations=[1/24] * len(image_paths))
   ```

   Note: The `durations` parameter specifies the duration (in seconds) each image should appear in the video. In this case, we set it to 1/24 (24 fps).

7. Set the output file path:
   ```python
   output_file = "/path/to/output.mp4"
   ```

8. Write the video file:
   ```python
   clip.write_videofile(output_file, fps=24)
   ```

That's it! The code will generate a video file named `output.mp4` in the specified output path, using the images from the provided directory. Each image will be displayed for 1/24 seconds (18 frames) to achieve a frame rate of 24 frames per second. Adjust the `image_directory` and `output_file` paths according to your specific setup.

one scrip not a bunch of pieces

Certainly! Here's a complete script that combines all the steps into one cohesive script:

```python
from moviepy.editor import ImageSequenceClip
import os

def create_video_from_images(image_directory, output_file):
    # Get a list of image file names in the directory
    image_files = sorted([f for f in os.listdir(image_directory) if f.endswith(".jpg") or f.endswith(".png")])

    # Create a list of image paths
    image_paths = [os.path.join(image_directory, filename) for filename in image_files]

    # Create a clip from the image sequence
    clip = ImageSequenceClip(image_paths, durations=[1/24] * len(image_paths))

    # Write the video file
    clip.write_videofile(output_file, fps=24)

# Set the directory path where your images are located
image_directory = "/path/to/directory"

# Set the output file path
output_file = "/path/to/output.mp4"

# Create the video from the images
create_video_from_images(image_directory, output_file)
```

Make sure to replace `"/path/to/directory"` with the actual path to your image directory and `"/path/to/output.mp4"` with the desired path and filename for the output video.

This script defines a function `create_video_from_images` that takes the image directory and output file path as parameters. It encapsulates all the necessary steps within the function. Finally, the script calls the function with the provided image directory and output file path to create the video.
