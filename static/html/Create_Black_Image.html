It looks like there are a couple of syntax errors in your code. Let's correct them and also include some logging for better understanding. I'll assume you want to create a black image with dimensions 640x640. Here's the corrected code:<br />
<br />
```python<br />
import logging<br />
from PIL import Image<br />
<br />
# Configure logging<br />
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)<br />
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)<br />
<br />
def create_black_image(width, height):<br />
    """<br />
    Create a black image with the specified width and height.<br />
<br />
    Parameters:<br />
    - width (int): The width of the image.<br />
    - height (int): The height of the image.<br />
<br />
    Returns:<br />
    - Image: The black image.<br />
    """<br />
    try:<br />
        # Creating a new black image<br />
        imnew = Image.new("RGB", (width, height), (0, 0, 0))<br />
<br />
        logging.info("Successfully created a black image.")<br />
        return imnew<br />
<br />
    except Exception as e:<br />
        logging.error(f"Error creating a black image: {e}")<br />
        return None<br />
<br />
# Example usage<br />
image_width = 640<br />
image_height = 640<br />
<br />
resulting_image = create_black_image(image_width, image_height)<br />
<br />
# Check if the image creation was successful<br />
if resulting_image:<br />
    # You can continue working with the 'resulting_image' here<br />
    pass<br />
else:<br />
    logging.error("Image creation failed. Check the logs for details.")<br />
```<br />
<br />
This script defines a function `create_black_image` that takes the width and height as parameters and returns a black image. The script also includes logging statements to provide information about the process and any potential errors. Feel free to adjust the width and height as needed for your project. Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else you'd like to add.<br />

os(get.cwd)<br />

It seems there's a small mistake in your code. The correct function to get the current working directory is `os.getcwd()`. Here's the corrected code with logging included:<br />
<br />
```python<br />
import os<br />
import logging<br />
<br />
# Configure logging<br />
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)<br />
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)<br />
<br />
def get_current_working_directory():<br />
    """<br />
    Get the current working directory.<br />
<br />
    Returns:<br />
    - str: The current working directory.<br />
    """<br />
    try:<br />
        # Getting the current working directory<br />
        cwd = os.getcwd()<br />
<br />
        logging.info(f"Current working directory: {cwd}")<br />
        return cwd<br />
<br />
    except Exception as e:<br />
        logging.error(f"Error getting the current working directory: {e}")<br />
        return None<br />
<br />
# Example usage<br />
current_directory = get_current_working_directory()<br />
<br />
# Check if getting the current working directory was successful<br />
if current_directory:<br />
    # You can continue working with the 'current_directory' here<br />
    pass<br />
else:<br />
    logging.error("Failed to get the current working directory. Check the logs for details.")<br />
```<br />
<br />
This script defines a function `get_current_working_directory` that retrieves and logs the current working directory. Adjust the script as needed for your use case. Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else you'd like assistance with.<br />
