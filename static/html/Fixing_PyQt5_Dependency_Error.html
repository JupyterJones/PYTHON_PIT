The error message you encountered suggests that there is an issue with the library dependencies of your PyQt5 module. Specifically, it seems that there is an undefined symbol related to `libgssapi_krb5.so.2` with the version `krb5_3_MIT`.<br />
<br />
To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:<br />
<br />
1. Update your system packages:<br />
   ```bash<br />
   sudo apt update<br />
   sudo apt upgrade<br />
   ```<br />
<br />
2. Verify that you have the necessary dependencies installed:<br />
   ```bash<br />
   sudo apt install libkrb5-dev<br />
   ```<br />
<br />
3. Ensure that you have the correct version of `libgssapi_krb5.so.2` installed. You can try reinstalling the package that provides this library:<br />
   ```bash<br />
   sudo apt install --reinstall libkrb5-3<br />
   ```<br />
<br />
4. If the issue persists, you can try removing the conflicting library and then reinstalling the `libkrb5-3` package:<br />
   ```bash<br />
   sudo apt remove libgssapi-krb5-2<br />
   sudo apt install --reinstall libkrb5-3<br />
   ```<br />
<br />
After following these steps, attempt to run your application again. Hopefully, the error should be resolved.<br />

I still have the problem:     Traceback (most recent call last):<br />

I apologize for the inconvenience. If the previous steps did not resolve the issue, you can try the following additional troubleshooting steps:<br />
<br />
1. Verify the version of `libgssapi_krb5.so.2` that is currently installed on your system:<br />
   ```bash<br />
   ls -l /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgssapi_krb5.so.2<br />
   ```<br />
<br />
2. If the version of `libgssapi_krb5.so.2` is not the expected version (`krb5_3_MIT`), you can try creating a symbolic link to the correct version. Replace `[path_to_correct_version]` with the appropriate path, which may vary depending on your system:<br />
   ```bash<br />
   sudo ln -sf [path_to_correct_version]/libgssapi_krb5.so.2 /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgssapi_krb5.so.2<br />
   ```<br />
<br />
3. If you're unsure about the correct version to use or if the symbolic link step did not work, you can try reinstalling the `libkrb5-3` package:<br />
   ```bash<br />
   sudo apt remove libkrb5-3<br />
   sudo apt install libkrb5-3<br />
   ```<br />
<br />
4. Restart your application and check if the issue has been resolved.<br />
<br />
If none of these steps resolve the problem, it's possible that there may be other underlying issues with your system's configuration. In such cases, you may consider reaching out to the PyQt5 or system administration communities for further assistance.<br />

ChatGPT<br />
Thank you for providing the output. It appears that the symbolic link for `libgssapi_krb5.so.2` is pointing to `libgssapi_krb5.so.2.2`. This indicates that the library version `libgssapi_krb5.so.2` is correct and should be compatible.<br />
<br />
Considering that the previous troubleshooting steps did not resolve the issue, it's possible that there may be a conflict between different versions of the `libgssapi_krb5.so.2` library on your system.<br />
<br />
In this case, you can try the following steps to force a reinstallation of the `libgssapi_krb5.so.2` library:<br />
<br />
1. Remove the existing symbolic link:<br />
   ```bash<br />
   sudo rm /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgssapi_krb5.so.2<br />
   ```<br />
<br />
2. Reinstall the `libkrb5-3` package, which should recreate the symbolic link:<br />
   ```bash<br />
   sudo apt remove libkrb5-3<br />
   sudo apt install libkrb5-3<br />
   ```<br />
<br />
3. Restart your application and check if the issue has been resolved.<br />
<br />
If the problem persists even after performing these steps, it may be necessary to delve deeper into your system configuration or seek assistance from the PyQt5 or system administration communities to identify and resolve the underlying cause of the issue.<br />

I apologize for the continued issue. It seems that the problem persists despite the previous troubleshooting steps. In such cases, you can try the following alternative solutions:<br />
<br />
1. Create a virtual environment and install PyQt5:<br />
   - Create a virtual environment:<br />
     ```bash<br />
     python3 -m venv myenv<br />
     ```<br />
   - Activate the virtual environment:<br />
     ```bash<br />
     source myenv/bin/activate<br />
     ```<br />
   - Install PyQt5 within the virtual environment:<br />
     ```bash<br />
     pip install pyqt5<br />
     ```<br />
<br />
2. Use the system package manager to install PyQt5:<br />
   - Uninstall any existing PyQt5 installation in the virtual environment:<br />
     ```bash<br />
     pip uninstall pyqt5<br />
     ```<br />
   - Install PyQt5 using the system package manager:<br />
     ```bash<br />
     sudo apt install python3-pyqt5<br />
     ```<br />
<br />
3. Consider using a different version of PyQt5:<br />
   - Uninstall any existing PyQt5 installation:<br />
     ```bash<br />
     pip uninstall pyqt5<br />
     ```<br />
   - Install a specific version of PyQt5:<br />
     ```bash<br />
     pip install pyqt5==5.14.0<br />
     ```<br />
<br />
4. If none of the above solutions work, you might need to consider reinstalling Python and PyQt5, ensuring that all dependencies are met and the installation is performed cleanly.<br />
<br />
Remember to activate the virtual environment if you created one before running your application.<br />

It appears that there is an error while building the wheel for PyQt5. The error message suggests that there might be an issue with the `sip` package, which is a dependency for PyQt5.<br />
<br />
To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:<br />
<br />
1. Upgrade the `sip` package to the latest version:<br />
   ```bash<br />
   pip install --upgrade sip<br />
   ```<br />
<br />
2. Clean the build directory for PyQt5:<br />
   ```bash<br />
   rm -rf /tmp/pip-install-6y3d0hof/PyQt5<br />
   ```<br />
<br />
3. Install PyQt5 again:<br />
   ```bash<br />
   pip install PyQt5==5.15.9<br />
   ```<br />
<br />
If the above steps do not resolve the issue, you can consider trying a different version of PyQt5. You can check the available versions using the following command:<br />
```bash<br />
pip search PyQt5<br />
```<br />
<br />
Choose a different version and install it with the appropriate command, replacing `&lt;version&gt;` with the desired version:<br />
```bash<br />
pip install PyQt5==&lt;version&gt;<br />
```<br />
<br />
If you continue to encounter errors, it's possible that there may be conflicts with your system configuration or other dependencies. In such cases, I recommend seeking assistance from the PyQt5 community or exploring alternative methods to install PyQt5, such as using system package managers or precompiled binaries.<br />

ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets'<br />
ChatGPT<br />
The error message suggests that the module `PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets` is not found. This issue could arise if the PyQt5 installation is incomplete or if the required package is not installed.<br />
<br />
To resolve this problem, you can try the following steps:<br />
<br />
1. Verify that PyQt5 is installed correctly. Run the following command to check the installed packages:<br />
   ```bash<br />
   pip list | grep PyQt5<br />
   ```<br />
<br />
   If PyQt5 is not listed, you can install it using the following command:<br />
   ```bash<br />
   pip install PyQt5<br />
   ```<br />
<br />
2. Ensure that the `python` executable you are using belongs to the same environment in which PyQt5 is installed. It's possible that there are multiple Python installations on your system, and you might need to activate the correct virtual environment or use the appropriate Python executable.<br />
<br />
3. If you have multiple versions of PyQt5 installed, it's possible that the version you need is not installed. In that case, you can try installing the PyQtWebEngine package separately:<br />
   ```bash<br />
   pip install PyQtWebEngine<br />
   ```<br />
<br />
4. If the issue persists, you can try uninstalling PyQt5 and reinstalling it to ensure a clean installation:<br />
   ```bash<br />
   pip uninstall PyQt5<br />
   pip install PyQt5<br />
   ```<br />
<br />
After trying these steps, attempt to run your application again. If the issue persists, it might be helpful to provide additional information about your environment and how you are running the application so that further troubleshooting can be done.<br />
