ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'modules.generator'; 'modules' is not a package<br />
<br />
ChatGPT<br />
The error message you provided indicates that there is a module import error in your code. Specifically, it states that there is no module named 'modules.generator', and it suggests that the 'modules' package does not exist.<br />
<br />
To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:<br />
<br />
1. Check if the 'modules' package or module is present in your codebase or project directory. Make sure that the module you are trying to import is located in the correct path and is accessible.<br />
<br />
2. Verify that you have the necessary dependencies installed. It seems like you are trying to import modules from the 'sync_batchnorm', 'generator', and 'keypoint_detector' packages. Ensure that these packages are installed in your environment using the appropriate package manager (e.g., pip).<br />
<br />
3. If the 'modules' package is part of your project and you still encounter this error, ensure that the package has an `__init__.py` file present. This file is required to mark the directory as a Python package.<br />
<br />
4. Double-check the spelling and capitalization of the module you are trying to import. It should match the actual module name, including any case-sensitive characters.<br />
<br />
By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the "No module named 'modules.generator'" error and successfully import the required module.<br />
