Hi everyone,

Im very happy to announce the release of Pymunk 5.0!


Background
---------- 

Pymunk is a easy-to-use pythonic 2d physics library that can be used whenever 
you need 2d rigid body physics from Python. Perfect when you need 2d physics 
in your game, demo or other application! It is built on top of the very 
capable 2d physics library Chipmunk.

See http://www.pymunk.org for more details and instructions on what Pymunk is 
and how to use it.


Changes
-------

This is a BIG release of Pymunk! Just in time before Pymunk turns 10 next year!

* Support for 64 Python on Windows
* Updated to use Chipmunk 7 which includes lots of great improvements
* Updated to use CFFI for wrapping, giving improved development and packaging 
  (wheels, yay!)
* New util module with draw help for matplotlib (with example Jupyter notebooks)
* Support for automatically generate geometry. Can be used for such things as
  deformable terrain (example included).
* Deprecated obsolete submodule pymunk.util.
* Lots of smaller improvements

New in this release is also testing on Travis and Appveyor to ensure good code 
quality.

I hope you will enjoy this new release!

Thanks,
Victor
