bash if not exist mkdir temp <br />
ChatGPT<br />
Certainly, Jack! If you want to create a directory named "temp" in Bash only if it doesn't already exist, you can use the following command:<br />
<br />
```bash<br />
if [ ! -d "temp" ]; then<br />
    mkdir temp<br />
fi<br />
```<br />
<br />
This script checks if the directory "temp" doesn't exist (`[ ! -d "temp" ]`) and if that condition is true, it creates the directory using `mkdir temp`.<br />
