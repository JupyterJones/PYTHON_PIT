what version is against API version 0xf<br />
ChatGPT<br />
As of my last update in September 2021, there is no specific information about an API version identified as "0xf." API version numbers typically follow a standard numerical format (e.g., 1, 2, 3, etc.) or use semantic versioning (e.g., 1.0.0, 2.1.5, etc.).<br />
<br />
If "0xf" refers to a hexadecimal number, it would be equal to 15 in decimal notation. However, without additional context or information about the specific API or technology you're referring to, it's challenging to provide a precise answer.<br />
<br />
If this is a recent development or a technology that emerged after my last update, I would not have information about it. I recommend checking official documentation or reliable sources related to the API in question to get the most up-to-date and accurate information.<br />

<br />
In NumPy, the API version is used to indicate changes to the C API. The version number is represented in hexadecimal format for historical reasons. API version 0xf (15 in decimal) was introduced in NumPy version 1.15.0.<br />
