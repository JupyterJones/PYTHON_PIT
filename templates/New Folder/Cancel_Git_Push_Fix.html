Hey Jack, it happens to the best of us! To stop a `git push` that has been started but you want to cancel, you can use the following steps:<br />
<br />
1. First, make sure you're in the same terminal or command prompt where you initiated the `git push`.<br />
<br />
2. Press `Ctrl + C` to interrupt the ongoing push operation. This sends an interrupt signal to the process, which should stop the push.<br />
<br />
3. After you've stopped the push, you can add your environment file to `.gitignore` to ensure it won't be pushed in the future. Edit your `.gitignore` file to include the path to your environment file, like this:<br />
<br />
   ```<br />
   # Add your environment file to .gitignore<br />
   .env<br />
   ```<br />
<br />
4. Save the changes to your `.gitignore` file.<br />
<br />
5. Now, you can commit the changes to your `.gitignore` file:<br />
<br />
   ```bash<br />
   git add .gitignore<br />
   git commit -m "Updated .gitignore to exclude .env"<br />
   ```<br />
<br />
6. Finally, you can push your updated `.gitignore` to the remote repository:<br />
<br />
   ```bash<br />
   git push<br />
   ```<br />
<br />
This way, your environment file will be excluded from future pushes, and you've resolved the issue. Let me know if you need further assistance or have any questions!<br />
