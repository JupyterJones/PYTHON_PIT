find new images from feb11 yesterday<br />
ChatGPT<br />
As an AI language model, I don't have direct access to real-time data or the ability to browse the internet. Therefore, I can't fetch or find new images from February 11th yesterday. You would need to manually search for new images using a search engine or visit websites where images are regularly updated. If you have specific criteria or sources in mind, I can guide you on how to conduct your search effectively. Let me know if you need further assistance!<br />

To find new images from February 11th using Python, you can use libraries such as `requests` for making HTTP requests and `BeautifulSoup` for parsing HTML content. Here's a basic example of how you can scrape images from a website:<br />
<br />
```python<br />
import requests<br />
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup<br />
import os<br />
import urllib<br />
<br />
# Function to download images<br />
def download_images(url, folder_path):<br />
    response = requests.get(url)<br />
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')<br />
    <br />
    # Find all img tags<br />
    img_tags = soup.find_all('img')<br />
    <br />
    # Create folder if it doesn't exist<br />
    if not os.path.exists(folder_path):<br />
        os.makedirs(folder_path)<br />
    <br />
    # Download images<br />
    for img in img_tags:<br />
        img_url = img['src']<br />
        img_name = img_url.split('/')[-1]<br />
        img_path = os.path.join(folder_path, img_name)<br />
        urllib.request.urlretrieve(img_url, img_path)<br />
        print(f"Downloaded {img_name} to {folder_path}")<br />
<br />
# Specify the URL of the website to scrape images from<br />
url = 'https://example.com'<br />
<br />
# Specify the folder path to save the images<br />
folder_path = 'images'<br />
<br />
# Call the function to download images<br />
download_images(url, folder_path)<br />
```<br />
<br />
Replace `'https://example.com'` with the URL of the website you want to scrape images from. This code will download all the images from that website and save them to a folder named `'images'`. You can modify the `url` variable to the website where you expect to find new images from February 11th and adjust the folder path as needed. Keep in mind that web scraping should be done responsibly and in compliance with the website's terms of service.<br />

images created on my computer all images created in the last two days\<br />
ChatGPT<br />
To find images created on your computer in the last two days using Python, you can utilize the `os` module to traverse directories and the `os.path` module to check file creation timestamps. Here's a Python script to accomplish this:<br />
<br />
```python<br />
import os<br />
import datetime<br />
<br />
# Function to find images created in the last two days<br />
def find_images_last_two_days(folder_path):<br />
    # Get current date<br />
    current_date = datetime.datetime.now()<br />
<br />
    # Calculate two days ago<br />
    two_days_ago = current_date - datetime.timedelta(days=2)<br />
<br />
    # List to store image files<br />
    image_files = []<br />
<br />
    # Traverse directory<br />
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(folder_path):<br />
        for file in files:<br />
            file_path = os.path.join(root, file)<br />
            # Check if the file is an image file and created within the last two days<br />
            if file.lower().endswith(('.png', '.jpg', '.jpeg', '.gif')) and \<br />
                    os.path.getctime(file_path) &gt; two_days_ago.timestamp():<br />
                image_files.append(file_path)<br />
<br />
    return image_files<br />
<br />
# Specify the folder path where you want to search for images<br />
folder_path = '/path/to/your/folder'<br />
<br />
# Call the function to find images created in the last two days<br />
images_last_two_days = find_images_last_two_days(folder_path)<br />
<br />
# Print the list of image files<br />
print("Images created in the last two days:")<br />
for image_file in images_last_two_days:<br />
    print(image_file)<br />
```<br />
<br />
Replace `'/path/to/your/folder'` with the actual path of the directory where you want to search for images. This script will recursively search through all directories within the specified folder and identify image files (PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF) that were created within the last two days. It will then print the list of image file paths.<br />

i need to print the results to a file<br />
ChatGPT<br />
To print the results to a file instead of the console, you can modify the script to write the paths of the found image files to a text file. Here's the updated script:<br />
<br />
```python<br />
import os<br />
import datetime<br />
<br />
# Function to find images created in the last two days<br />
def find_images_last_two_days(folder_path):<br />
    # Get current date<br />
    current_date = datetime.datetime.now()<br />
<br />
    # Calculate two days ago<br />
    two_days_ago = current_date - datetime.timedelta(days=2)<br />
<br />
    # List to store image files<br />
    image_files = []<br />
<br />
    # Traverse directory<br />
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(folder_path):<br />
        for file in files:<br />
            file_path = os.path.join(root, file)<br />
            # Check if the file is an image file and created within the last two days<br />
            if file.lower().endswith(('.png', '.jpg', '.jpeg', '.gif')) and \<br />
                    os.path.getctime(file_path) &gt; two_days_ago.timestamp():<br />
                image_files.append(file_path)<br />
<br />
    return image_files<br />
<br />
# Specify the folder path where you want to search for images<br />
folder_path = '/path/to/your/folder'<br />
<br />
# Call the function to find images created in the last two days<br />
images_last_two_days = find_images_last_two_days(folder_path)<br />
<br />
# Specify the output file path<br />
output_file_path = 'image_files_last_two_days.txt'<br />
<br />
# Write the image file paths to the output file<br />
with open(output_file_path, 'w') as file:<br />
    for image_file in images_last_two_days:<br />
        file.write(image_file + '\n')<br />
<br />
print(f"Results saved to {output_file_path}")<br />
```<br />
<br />
Replace `'/path/to/your/folder'` with the actual path of the directory where you want to search for images, and `'image_files_last_two_days.txt'` with the desired filename for the output file. This script will write the paths of the found image files to the specified text file.<br />

i want to search walk, get two sample images from every directory that has over 10 images<br />
save in directory:   SAMPLES/<br />
ii want the names to be the image path replacing the / with a _<br />
Example:  /home/jack/Desktop/EXP_notebooks/z-KREA/00025.jpg  would be<br />
SAMPLES/_home_jack_Desktop_EXP_notebooks_z-KREA_00025.jpg<br />
<br />
ChatGPT<br />
You can achieve this by slightly modifying the previous script to walk through directories, count the number of images in each directory, and then copy two sample images from directories with over 10 images to the specified `SAMPLES` directory with the desired filename format. Here's the updated script:<br />
<br />
```python<br />
import os<br />
import shutil<br />
<br />
# Function to get two sample images from directories with over 10 images<br />
def get_sample_images(folder_path, samples_folder):<br />
    # Create samples directory if it doesn't exist<br />
    if not os.path.exists(samples_folder):<br />
        os.makedirs(samples_folder)<br />
<br />
    # Traverse directory<br />
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(folder_path):<br />
        image_files = [file for file in files if file.lower().endswith(('.png', '.jpg', '.jpeg', '.gif'))]<br />
        if len(image_files) &gt; 10:<br />
            # Copy two sample images<br />
            sample_images = image_files[:2]<br />
            for image_file in sample_images:<br />
                src_path = os.path.join(root, image_file)<br />
                dst_path = os.path.join(samples_folder, image_file.replace('/', '_'))<br />
                shutil.copy(src_path, dst_path)<br />
                print(f"Copied {src_path} to {dst_path}")<br />
<br />
# Specify the folder path to search for images<br />
folder_path = '/path/to/your/folder'<br />
<br />
# Specify the folder path to save sample images<br />
samples_folder = 'SAMPLES'<br />
<br />
# Call the function to get sample images from directories with over 10 images<br />
get_sample_images(folder_path, samples_folder)<br />
```<br />
<br />
Replace `'/path/to/your/folder'` with the actual path of the directory where you want to search for images, and `'SAMPLES'` with the desired name for the directory to save sample images. This script will copy two sample images from each directory containing over 10 images to the `SAMPLES` directory with the desired filename format.<br />

what is max length for a filename ?<br />
ChatGPT<br />
The maximum length for a filename depends on the operating system and file system being used. Here are the typical maximum filename lengths for some common operating systems and file systems:<br />
<br />
1. **Windows**:<br />
   - For NTFS (New Technology File System), the maximum filename length is 255 characters.<br />
   - For FAT32 (File Allocation Table), the maximum filename length is 255 characters.<br />
   - For exFAT (Extended File Allocation Table), the maximum filename length is 255 characters.<br />
   - Note: The full path length (including the filename and directory structure) is limited to 260 characters in Windows.<br />
<br />
2. **macOS** (Unix-based):<br />
   - The maximum filename length is 255 characters.<br />
<br />
3. **Linux** (Unix-based):<br />
   - The maximum filename length is 255 characters.<br />
<br />
It's important to note that while these are the typical maximum lengths, the actual limit may vary depending on specific configurations and file system settings. Additionally, some file systems may have further restrictions on specific characters or reserved names.<br />

i want the entire path in the filename  <br />
i want the names to be the image path replacing the / with a _<br />
Example:  /home/jack/Desktop/EXP_notebooks/z-KREA/00025.jpg  would be<br />
SAMPLES/_home_jack_Desktop_EXP_notebooks_z-KREA_00025.jpg<br />
<br />
ChatGPT<br />
Understood. To achieve this, you can modify the script to include the entire file path in the filename, replacing the '/' characters with underscores. Here's the updated script:<br />
<br />
```python<br />
import os<br />
import shutil<br />
<br />
# Function to get two sample images from directories with over 10 images<br />
def get_sample_images(folder_path, samples_folder):<br />
    # Create samples directory if it doesn't exist<br />
    if not os.path.exists(samples_folder):<br />
        os.makedirs(samples_folder)<br />
<br />
    # Traverse directory<br />
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(folder_path):<br />
        image_files = [file for file in files if file.lower().endswith(('.png', '.jpg', '.jpeg', '.gif'))]<br />
        if len(image_files) &gt; 10:<br />
            # Copy two sample images<br />
            sample_images = image_files[:2]<br />
            for image_file in sample_images:<br />
                src_path = os.path.join(root, image_file)<br />
                # Construct new filename<br />
                new_filename = os.path.join(samples_folder, '_' + root.replace('/', '_') + '_' + image_file)<br />
                # Copy file with new filename<br />
                shutil.copy(src_path, new_filename)<br />
                print(f"Copied {src_path} to {new_filename}")<br />
<br />
# Specify the folder path to search for images<br />
folder_path = '/path/to/your/folder'<br />
<br />
# Specify the folder path to save sample images<br />
samples_folder = 'SAMPLES'<br />
<br />
# Call the function to get sample images from directories with over 10 images<br />
get_sample_images(folder_path, samples_folder)<br />
```<br />
<br />
Replace `'/path/to/your/folder'` with the actual path of the directory where you want to search for images, and `'SAMPLES'` with the desired name for the directory to save sample images. This script will copy two sample images from each directory containing over 10 images to the `SAMPLES` directory with the filename constructed as specified.<br />
