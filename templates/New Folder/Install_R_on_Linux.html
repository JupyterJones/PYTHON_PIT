<br />
1. **Open a Terminal**: Launch the terminal on your Linux computer. You can usually find it in the Applications or System Tools menu.<br />

<br />
   ```bash<br />
   sudo apt install r-base<br />
   ```<br />
<br />
   This will install the R programming language on your system.<br />
<br />
4. **Verify Installation**: After the installation is complete, you can verify that R was installed successfully by opening the R interpreter. Type `R` in the terminal and press Enter. This will start the R console.<br />
<br />
5. **Exit R Console**: To exit the R console, simply type `q()` and press Enter.<br />
<br />
And that's it! You now have R installed on your Linux computer. If you need to use any specific R packages in your projects, you can install them using the `install.packages()` function within the R console.<br />

ChatGPT<br />
Absolutely, Jack! You can install R and R Notebooks, which are also known as R Markdown Notebooks, to create interactive and executable documents. Here's a step-by-step guide to installing R Notebooks on your Linux computer:<br />
<br />
1. **Open a Terminal**: Launch the terminal on your Linux computer.<br />
<br />
2. **Install R**: If you haven't already installed R, you can do so using the following command:<br />
<br />
   ```bash<br />
   sudo apt update<br />
   sudo apt install r-base<br />
   ```<br />
<br />
3. **Install RStudio**: RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R that provides a user-friendly interface for writing and executing R code. You can install RStudio by visiting the official download page and downloading the appropriate version for your Linux distribution: [RStudio Download](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)<br />
<br />
   After downloading, navigate to the download directory and use the following command to install it (replace `rstudio-version` with the actual version you downloaded):<br />
<br />
   ```bash<br />
   sudo dpkg -i rstudio-version.deb<br />
   ```<br />
<br />
   RStudio will also help you manage R packages and create R Notebooks.<br />
<br />
4. **Create an R Notebook**: Once you have RStudio installed, open it. You can create a new R Notebook by going to `File &gt; New File &gt; R Notebook`.<br />
<br />
   R Notebooks allow you to combine R code chunks, Markdown text, and visualizations in a single document. They are great for creating reports, tutorials, and interactive documents.<br />
<br />
5. **Run R Code Chunks**: In an R Notebook, you can write and execute R code chunks. Simply surround your R code with three backticks and specify "r" immediately after them. For example:<br />
<br />
   \```{r}<br />
   # Your R code here<br />
   ```<br />
<br />
   After writing your R code chunk, you can run it by clicking the "Run" button in the top-right corner of the chunk.<br />
<br />
6. **Save and Execute**: As you work in your R Notebook, be sure to save your document regularly. You can also execute the entire notebook or individual code chunks.<br />
<br />
7. **Render as HTML or PDF**: You can render your R Notebook as an HTML or PDF document by clicking the "Knit" button. This will generate a standalone document with your R code, text, and visualizations.<br />
<br />
Remember that R Notebooks provide a fantastic way to create interactive documents and tutorials, allowing you to combine code, visualizations, and explanations seamlessly.<br />
