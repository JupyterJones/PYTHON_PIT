how to start a python server to serve files<br />
ChatGPT<br />
Certainly, Jack! Starting a Python server to serve files is quite straightforward. You can use the built-in `http.server` module. Here's a simple script that creates a basic file server:<br />
<br />
```python<br />
import http.server<br />
import socketserver<br />
import logging<br />
<br />
# Set up logging<br />
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)<br />
logger = logging.getLogger("FileServer")<br />
<br />
# Define the port you want to use<br />
port = 8000<br />
<br />
# Define the handler to use (SimpleHTTPRequestHandler serves files from the current directory)<br />
handler = http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler<br />
<br />
# Start the server<br />
with socketserver.TCPServer(("", port), handler) as httpd:<br />
    logger.info(f"Serving on port {port}")<br />
    try:<br />
        # This will serve files indefinitely until you stop the script manually (Ctrl+C)<br />
        httpd.serve_forever()<br />
    except KeyboardInterrupt:<br />
        logger.info("Server stopped.")<br />
```<br />
<br />
Save this script with a `.py` extension, for example, `file_server.py`, and run it using the command:<br />
<br />
```bash<br />
python file_server.py<br />
```<br />
<br />
This will start a server on port 8000, and you can access your files by navigating to `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser.<br />
<br />

a one liner for the terminal<br />
ChatGPT<br />
Certainly, Jack! You can use Python's built-in HTTP server directly from the terminal with this one-liner:<br />
<br />
```bash<br />
python -m http.server 8000<br />
```<br />
<br />
Replace `8000` with the port you prefer. Just navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser, and you'll have your files served.<br />
